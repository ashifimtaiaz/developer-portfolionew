            <h2>Become a web Developer</h2>
            <p>Dreaming big means having the mental freedom to think about what you really want out of life and forget
                about all the
                reasons why you can't make it a reality. ... Someone could use dreaming big to motivate themselves to
                see the bigger
                picture of what they really want in life.</p>
